        when the originator transfers an outbound call we need to reset fail_on_single_reject
        example:
            A calls offnet, fail_on_single_reject is set on leg B so that we don't retry carriers
            reasons set may include BUSY
            A transfers the outgoing call to another extension/user
            if extension/user has a device in DND it will return BUSY and will hit fail_on_single_reject
            resetting the fail_on_single_reject on blind trasfer supports this callflow
